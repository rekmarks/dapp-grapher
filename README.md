# dapp-grapher
Takes one or several smart contracts as inputs and represents their relationships as a graph

# todo
- 
- Improve web3 error handling (currently perfunctory/unrealistic)
- UX
    - Add modal that can only be closed by logging in to MetaMask (check using web3.eth.getAccounts() on a handler for a user-triggered event, like clicking "OK" in the modal)
